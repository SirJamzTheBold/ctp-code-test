# Instagram (PHP Test)

##Instructions
In this directory you will find two files, api.php and index.php. The api.php file contains a simple curl to the Instagram API. This stores json data that can then be parsed out.

Using the provided script create a gallery in index.php. This should include thumbnails that expand and show the full size image, caption, and link to the original content on Instagram.

You can access the json feed here
