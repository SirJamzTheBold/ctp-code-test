# Instructions

Given the following array:

```
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
```

write a program that will console.log each item with a one second pause between each number.
The result should look something like this:

[wait 1 second]
1
[wait 1 second]
2
[wait 1 second]
3
[wait 1 second]
4

## Note:
This must be accomplished without the use of forEach.

## Bonus:
Why would using forEach make this problem easier?
